          <p>
            Mark Zuckerberg co-founded the social-networking website Facebook
            out of his college dorm room at Harvard University. Zuckerberg left
            college after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site, the
            user base of which has grown to more than two billion people, making
            Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over. The birth of Facebook was
            portrayed in the 2010 film The Social Network.

            Paul Allen founded and built the world's largest software business,

          <h2>Larry Page</h2>
          <p>
            Born in Michigan in 1973, Larry Page's parents were both computer
            experts. Following in their footsteps, he studied computer
            engineering at Stanford University, where he met Sergey Brin. The
            duo developed a search engine that listed results according to the
            popularity of the pages and, with Page as CEO, Google became the
            world's most popular search engine after launching in 1998. Page and
            Brin later took charge of Google's new parent company, Alphabet,
            until stepping down from their everyday roles in late 2019.
